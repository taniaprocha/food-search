# Food Search

Food search display a list of food. You can type a name to search a food, order the food list by micronutrient, and create new ones.

Clicking in a food will open a modal with the food info. You can edit the information or delete the food.

I used a rails-starter (https://github.com/aurora-digital/rails-starter) to start the project.
